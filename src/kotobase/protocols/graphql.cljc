(ns kotobase.protocols.graphql
  "graphql.kotobase.net -- a GraphQL over HTTP (graphql.github.io/graphql-over-http/)
  query surface over kotobase, wiring the pure `kotoba-lang/graphql` SDL/executor
  library to the shared `kotobase.query.bridge` (ADR-2607172300 in
  `com-junkawasaki/root`), per ADR-2607172500.

  ## Division of labour (read this before touching parsing/execution code)

  `kotoba-lang/graphql` (`graphql.sdl`/`graphql.query`/`graphql.validate`/
  `graphql.execute`) does ALL of: SDL -> schema EDN, query string -> selection
  AST, schema structural validation, and field-resolution execution over
  host-injected resolvers. This namespace does NOT reimplement any of that --
  it is the HTTP transport + a small amount of GraphQL-over-HTTP-shaped glue
  the library deliberately leaves to its host:

  1. decode the request body per the GraphQL-over-HTTP `POST` shape
     (`{\"query\" \"...\" \"variables\" {...} \"operationName\" \"...\"}`),
  2. reject the two things explicitly out of v0.1 scope (mutations/
     subscriptions -- ADR-2607172500's \"query-only\" boundary; `$variable`
     references -- `graphql.query/parse-query` does not bind variables, see
     its own README, so silently accepting them would silently misexecute),
  3. run `graphql.query/parse-query` + a small QUERY-level field-existence
     check against the schema (`graphql.validate` only checks the SCHEMA's
     own structural well-formedness, e.g. \"does every field type exist\" --
     it does not check that a REQUEST's selected fields exist on the schema,
     which is this namespace's own job, same division of labour any GraphQL
     HTTP host has),
  4. run `graphql.execute/execute-query` with resolvers that call into
     `kotobase.query.bridge` (materialize + `arrangement.datalog` query),
     threading the REQUIRED `:visible?` predicate through every resolver,
  5. shape the result as `{\"data\" ... \"errors\" [...]}` per the GraphQL
     over HTTP spec.

  ## Wire shape: `POST /graphql`

  Request body (JSON):
  ```json
  {\"query\": \"{ user(id: \\\"u1\\\") { name department { name budget } } }\"}
  ```
  Response body (JSON):
  ```json
  {\"data\": {\"user\": {\"name\": \"Alice\",
                        \"department\": {\"name\": \"Engineering\" \"budget\" 900000}}}}
  ```

  Per the GraphQL over HTTP spec's request-error vs field-error split:
  - malformed JSON body, missing/non-string `\"query\"`, unsupported
    mutation/subscription operations, `$variable` references, or a query
    that fails this namespace's schema field-existence check -- these are
    REQUEST errors: no execution is attempted, HTTP 400, body is
    `{\"errors\" [...]}` with **no** `\"data\"` key.
  - a resolver throwing during execution (this repo's own resolver code,
    e.g. a bad argument coercion) is an EXECUTION error: HTTP 200 (per
    spec, since execution began), body is `{\"data\" null \"errors\" [...]}`.
    `graphql.execute` is a pure, single-pass, whole-query executor with no
    per-field error tracking (see its own docstring: \"IResolver/resolve is
    called ... assuming pure functions\") -- so v0.1 cannot offer partial
    `data` alongside `errors` the way a full GraphQL server would; a
    thrown resolver error aborts the whole request's data, mirroring how
    the sibling `org-opencypher-cypher` surface aborts its whole
    transaction on the first failing statement rather than fabricate a
    partial result.
  - otherwise: HTTP 200, `{\"data\" {...}}` (no `\"errors\"` key when there
    are none).

  ## v0.1 scope boundary (ADR-2607172500) -- explicit rejection, not silent misbehaviour

  - **query-only**: `mutation { ... }` / `subscription { ... }` operations
    are rejected with a named error, never silently executed as if they
    were queries.
  - **no `$variable` substitution**: `graphql.query/parse-query`'s own
    README states variable binding is unsupported; a query containing a
    `$name` token would otherwise be silently mis-tokenized (the raw
    identifier becomes an enum-shaped string literal) rather than bound to
    the request's `\"variables\"` value -- this namespace detects `$name`
    tokens up front and rejects the request with a clear message instead
    of executing that silent misinterpretation. Use inline literal
    argument values instead.
  - **no schema-from-IStore-collections auto-derivation**: the ADR
    explicitly rejects this as v0.1 scope creep. The schema (a
    `graphql.model` EDN map, typically built via `graphql.sdl/parse-schema`)
    and the field-resolver registry are supplied by the deploy shell / test
    fixtures via `ctx` -- see `resolver` below and
    `test/kotobase/protocols/graphql_test.cljc` for a full worked example
    (SDL schema + resolvers backed by two `kotobase.store` collections,
    including one cross-collection-join resolver).

  ## `visible?` -- required, injectable, never defaulted

  `ctx` passed to `handle` MUST include `:visible?`, a predicate over
  materialized datoms (`(fn [{:keys [s p o]}] boolean?)`) -- the same
  discipline `kotobase.query.bridge`/`arrangement.datalog` enforce
  (ADR-2607050500, \"Query as first-class effect\"). `handle` throws
  immediately (a ctx-construction bug, not a wire-protocol error) if
  `:visible?` is missing. Resolvers built via `resolver` receive `ctx` as
  `{:store IStore :visible? (fn [datom] boolean?)}` (the same map every
  resolver fn in the registry is called with, as `graphql.execute`'s third
  positional `ctx` argument) -- there is no silent `(constantly true)`
  fallback baked into this namespace; every fixture/deploy resolver must
  itself pass `visible?` on to `kotobase.query.bridge/query`.

  ## Audit choice

  Same read-only-surface audit discipline as `org-opencypher-cypher`
  (ADR-2607050500's \"query as first-class effect\"): every processed
  request is appended to the shared `:kotobase.protocols/audit` stream --
  `{:surface :graphql :op :query :query <raw query text> :now ...}` on
  success, `{:surface :graphql :op :query-error :query <raw query text>
  :error ... :now ...}` on failure. Resolved DATA is never audited, only
  the caller's own raw query text (there are no `$variable` values to leak
  in v0.1, since those are rejected outright)."
